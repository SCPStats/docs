# Getting Started

Welcome to SCPStats! You're on your way to adding global stat tracking and supercharging your server's capabilities. Setting SCPStats up takes around 5 minutes. Let's get started!

## Features

SCPStats has a ton of features, and you can get more information about them on their documentation pages, so here's a brief overview of what SCPStats has to offer:
- Global and server stat tracking (keep track of your players' kills, deaths, playtime, etc. on every server using SCPStats or just your own).
- Advanced ban and moderation management (sync bans across all of your servers and allow your moderators to manage bans and players from an easy-to-use online panel).
- Rolesync to automatically give discord members, boosters, and donators their in-game badges and ranks.
- Leaderboards and rankings to see how your stats compare to others.

## Support

If you have any issues setting up SCPStats, feel free to join the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QM4hzRFq) and ask for help.

## Setup

The first thing you need to do is install the [SCPStats plugin](https://github.com/SCPStats/Plugin/releases/latest). Simply download `SCPStats.dll`, then drag it into your `Plugins` directory. Make sure that you have [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) installed on your server in order to use plugins. Once SCPStats is installed, restart your server and keep reading.

The next thing you need to do is register your gameserver with SCPStats. To do this, head over to the [SCPStats Panel](https://panel.scpstats.com/myservers) and under the `My Servers` section, create a new server (make sure you create an SCPStats server for each of your gameservers). You can name this server whatever you like, but you should probably keep it the same as what your gameserver is called. Next, open up the newly created SCPStats server and click the `View Secret` button. This will open up a menu with a command that you can paste into your server console. Once that's done, you're all set for stat tracking, but keep reading if you want to use SCPStats' other features.

Now that your SCPStats server is connected to a gameserver, you'll need to link the SCPStats server to your discord server. This is fairly simple, first invite the [SCPStats Bot](https://top.gg/bot/741924143070707732/invite) to your discord server. Next, go back to the `My Servers` page in the [SCPStats Panel](https://panel.scpstats.com/myservers) and click the `Link to Discord` button and run the command in your discord server (remember to do this for each of your SCPStats servers). Once that's done, SCPStats is fully setup and ready to use! Check out the `Features` menu to your left in order to learn how to setup SCPStats' features.
